# Product-Landing-Page
This is a product landing page developed as part of the FreeCodeCamp projects.
For this product landing page, I used the brand **Branch** as inspiration. All images were taken from their website, and this project is for practice purposes only. I do not sell these products, nor were they created by me.

If you want to see the finished site, visit this link: https://eilynvargas.github.io/Product-Landing-Page/

I added some functionalities that unfortunately are not supported for all browsers, so I'll be doing some changes to this site coming soon!
